            <h3>celebrating the DevOps art</h3>
            <p>In the realm where code and operations meet,
                Lies a harmony sought, so swift and sweet.
                A tale of DevOps, a wondrous domain,
                Where collaboration ignites a tech refrain.
                
                In the depths of servers and networks unseen,
                The DevOps magician weaves a vibrant dream.
                They blend the worlds of dev and ops with grace,
                To build a symphony in a digital space.
                
                With agility as their guiding light,
                They shatter barriers, reach new heights.
                No longer confined to separate spheres,
                DevOps emerges, banishing our fears.
                
                In the realm of automation, they find their way,
                Scripting spells to simplify our day.
                Tools and pipelines, their enchanted wands,
                Empowering teams to respond and correspond.
                
                They foster a culture of continuous change,
                Adapting swiftly, never feeling estranged.
                Feedback loops, they refine and nourish,
                Creating an environment that can flourish.
                
                Collaboration dances, hand in hand,
                Developers and operators, an integrated band.
                Together they bridge the gap and unite,
                Delivering software with unyielding might.
                
                With empathy and communication as their guide,
                DevOps warriors stand side by side.
                They break down silos, build trust anew,
                Enabling innovation to break through.
                
                In this symphony of bits and bytes,
                DevOps orchestrates harmonious nights.
                Their melody sings of efficiency and speed,
                A revolution in how we succeed.
                
                So let us celebrate this DevOps art,
                A poetic dance of the digital heart.
                For in this union of dev and ops we find,
                A powerful force that leaves no code behind.</p>
